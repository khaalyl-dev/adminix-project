# AI Integration Testing Guide

This guide will help you test the AI-powered analytics features in the AdminiX project.

## üöÄ Quick Test Setup

### 1. Start All Services
```bash
./start-all.sh
```

This will start:
- ML Service on http://localhost:3000
- Backend on http://localhost:8000
- Client on http://localhost:5173

### 2. Verify Services Are Running
```bash
# Check if services are running
curl http://localhost:3000/health  # ML Service
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health  # Backend (if available)
```

## üß™ Testing Scenarios

## üêõ Troubleshooting Tests

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue 1: ML Service Not Starting
```bash
# Check if Python is installed
python3 --version

# Check if virtual environment exists
ls ml-service/venv/

# Recreate virtual environment if needed
cd ml-service
rm -rf venv
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Issue 2: CORS Errors
- The ML service includes CORS middleware
- Check that requests are going to http://localhost:8000
- Verify the frontend is making requests to the correct URL

#### Issue 3: Port Conflicts
```bash
# Check what's running on each port
lsof -i :8000  # ML Service
lsof -i :5000  # Backend
lsof -i :5173  # Client

# Kill processes if needed
kill -9 <PID>
```

#### Issue 4: Model Loading Issues
```bash
# Check if model files exist
ls ml-service/models/

# Expected files:
# - complexity_model.pkl
# - priority_model.pkl
# - risk_model.pkl
```

### Debug Mode Testing

#### Enable Debug Mode for ML Service
```bash
cd ml-service
source venv/bin/activate
python -m uvicorn api:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --log-level debug
```

#### Check Logs
```bash
# ML Service logs will show in the terminal
# Look for:
# - Model loading messages
# - API request logs
# - Error messages
```

## üìä Performance Testing

### Load Testing
```bash
# Test multiple concurrent requests
for i in {1..10}; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/predict/task \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"task_text": "Test task $i"}' &
done
wait
```

### Response Time Testing
```bash
# Test response times
time curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/predict/task \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"task_text": "Complex task with many features"}'
```

## üß™ Automated Testing

### Create Test Script
```bash
# Create test script
cat > test-ai-integration.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash

echo "üß™ Testing AI Integration..."

# Test health endpoint
echo "1. Testing health endpoint..."
curl -s http://localhost:8000/health | jq .

# Test task prediction
echo "2. Testing task prediction..."
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/predict/task \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"task_text": "Test task"}' | jq .

# Test sprint planning
echo "3. Testing sprint planning..."
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/predict/project/sprints \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "project_title": "Test Project",
    "project_description": "Test project description",
    "sprint_capacity": 40,
    "max_sprints": 5
  }' | jq .

echo "‚úÖ All tests completed!"
EOF

chmod +x test-ai-integration.sh
```

### Run Automated Tests
