# Common Routes Directory

This directory contains shared route definitions and utilities for the AdminiX client application's routing system:

- **routes.tsx**: Defines shared route definitions and route arrays for the application. Used to organize and export route configurations for use in the main router.
- **routePaths.ts**: Defines and exports common route path constants to avoid hardcoding route strings throughout the codebase.
- **README.md**: This file. Explains the purpose and main functionality of each file in the folder.

Each file is commented to explain its main components and logic.
