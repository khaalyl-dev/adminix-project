# Types Directory

This directory contains TypeScript type definitions and interfaces for the AdminiX client application. Each file is responsible for a specific aspect of type safety and API modeling:

- **api.type.ts**: Defines TypeScript types and interfaces for API responses, request payloads, and domain models used throughout the client application.
- **custom-error.type.ts**: Defines a custom error type for handling API and application errors in a structured way.
- **README.md**: This file. Explains the purpose and main functionality of each file in the folder.

Each file is commented to explain its main types and logic.
