This directory contains the main pages for workspace-related features in the AdminiX client application. Each file is responsible for a specific aspect of the workspace experience:

- **ProjectDetails.tsx**: The main Project Details page, including analytics, tasks, activity log, events, and sidebar for a project workspace. Handles data fetching and tab navigation.
- **ScheduleMeeting.tsx**: UI and logic for scheduling Google Meet meetings, managing guests, and displaying the meeting link.
- **Tasks.tsx**: Renders the main Tasks page for a workspace, displaying the task table and a button to create new tasks.
- **Dashboard.tsx**: The main dashboard for a workspace, including workspace analytics, recent projects, tasks, and members.
- **Settings.tsx**: The workspace settings page, allowing users to manage workspace settings and configurations.
- **Members.tsx**: Displays the members of a workspace, including member management and invitations.

Each file is commented to explain its main components and logic.
