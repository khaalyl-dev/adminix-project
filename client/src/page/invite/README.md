# Invite Page Directory

This directory contains the files for the workspace invitation feature in the AdminiX client application. Each file is responsible for a specific aspect of the invite experience:

- **InviteUser.tsx**: The main React component for handling workspace invitations. Provides the UI and logic for inviting a user to join a workspace via an invite link, including authentication, joining the workspace, and user feedback.
- **README.md**: This file. Explains the purpose and main functionality of each file in the folder.

Each file is commented to explain its main components and logic.
