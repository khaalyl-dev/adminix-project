# Controllers Directory

This directory contains controller files for the backend application. Each controller is responsible for handling API requests and business logic for a specific resource:

- **auth.controller.ts**: Handles authentication-related endpoints (login, signup, etc.).
- **meeting.controller.ts**: Handles meeting-related endpoints.
- **member.controller.ts**: Handles member management endpoints.
- **project.controller.ts**: Handles project management endpoints.
- **task.controller.ts**: Handles task management endpoints.
- **user.controller.ts**: Handles user management endpoints.
- **workspace.controller.ts**: Handles workspace management endpoints.

Controllers receive HTTP requests, interact with services/models, and return responses to the client.
