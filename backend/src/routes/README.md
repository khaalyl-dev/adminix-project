# Routes Directory

This directory contains Express route files for the backend application. Each file defines the API endpoints for a specific resource:

- **auth.routes.ts**: Authentication endpoints (login, signup, etc.).
- **meeting.route.ts**: Meeting-related endpoints.
- **member.route.ts**: Member management endpoints.
- **project.route.ts**: Project management endpoints.
- **task.route.ts**: Task management endpoints.
- **user.route.ts**: User management endpoints.
- **workspace.route.ts**: Workspace management endpoints.

Routes map HTTP requests to controller actions and middleware.
