## Super Admin Functionality

### What is Super Admin?
A Super Admin is a special user role with the ability to view all workspaces in the system, regardless of ownership or membership. The Super Admin cannot create, edit, or delete workspaces, projects, or tasksâ€”only view them.

---

## How Super Admin Works
- **Role:** `SUPER_ADMIN` is defined in `src/enums/role.enum.ts` and added to the user model.
- **Permissions:** Only has `VIEW_ONLY` permission, as set in `src/utils/role-permission.ts`.
- **Workspace Access:** Can view all workspaces, even if not a member, via updated logic in `getAllWorkspacesUserIsMemberService` and `getMemberRoleInWorkspace`.
- **Cannot Modify:** All create/edit/delete actions are denied for SUPER_ADMIN by permission checks.

## How to Seed a Super Admin
1. Ensure your `.env` file has a valid `MONGO_URL`.
2. Run the seeder script:
   ```sh
   npx ts-node src/seeders/superadmin.seeder.ts
   ```
3. This will create a user with:
   - Email: `contact@digix.tn`
   - Password: `SuperSecurePassword123`
   - Role: `SUPER_ADMIN`

## Key Code Updates

### 1. User Model (`src/models/user.model.ts`)
- Added `role` field to the schema and interface.
- Default role is `MEMBER`.

### 2. Role Enum (`src/enums/role.enum.ts`)
- Added `SUPER_ADMIN` to the `Roles` object and `RoleType`.

### 3. Role Permissions (`src/utils/role-permission.ts`)
- Added `SUPER_ADMIN` with only `VIEW_ONLY` permission.

### 4. Seeder Script (`src/seeders/superadmin.seeder.ts`)
- Seeds a Super Admin user and creates an associated account for login.

### 5. Workspace Fetching (`src/services/workspace.service.ts`)
- `getAllWorkspacesUserIsMemberService` returns all workspaces for SUPER_ADMIN.

### 6. Membership Check (`src/services/member.service.ts`)
- `getMemberRoleInWorkspace` allows SUPER_ADMIN to access any workspace, even if not a member.

## Comments in Code
- All new logic for SUPER_ADMIN is commented in the relevant files for clarity.

## Usage
- Log in as super admin using the seeded credentials.
- You will be able to view all workspaces and their contents, but not modify them.

---

## Security Note
- Change the default super admin password after first login.
- Do not share super admin credentials.
