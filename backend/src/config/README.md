# Config Directory

This directory contains configuration files for the backend application. Each file is responsible for configuring a specific aspect of the backend:

- **app.config.ts**: Application-wide settings and environment configuration.
- **database.config.ts**: Database connection and related options.
- **http.config.ts**: HTTP server settings, such as port and middleware.
- **passport.config.ts**: Passport.js authentication strategies and middleware setup.

Modify these files to adjust the backend's configuration as needed for your environment.
