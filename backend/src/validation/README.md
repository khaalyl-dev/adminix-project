# Validation Directory

This directory contains validation files for the backend application. Each file defines validation schemas and logic for API requests related to a specific resource:

- **auth.validation.ts**: Validation for authentication requests (login, signup, etc.).
- **project.validation.ts**: Validation for project-related requests.
- **task.validation.ts**: Validation for task-related requests.
- **workspace.validation.ts**: Validation for workspace-related requests.

Use these validation files to ensure incoming data is correct and secure before processing.
